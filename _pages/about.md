Most content here was created by Emile Kroeger  (who has previously worked at Alderbaran, among others making applications and teaching people how to make applications) and Taylor Veltrop (who has created several of the core systems in Pepper and NAO) - as a result we know quite a bit about how those robots work; we later founded the company [RoboHearts](https://www.robohearts.eu/) where we still work on NAO and Pepper - see over there for more on what we do!

We created RoboHearts.DEV as a place to centralize information about these robots, as info about how to use them has become quite fragmented. Feel free to contact us at contact@robohearts.eu if something is missing!
