Welcome to the Pepper Programming Guide!

So, you want to program your Pepper robot? The approach depends on which version you have:

## Pepper 2.9 (Android-based) - Current Generation

| What do you want to do?    | How can you do that? |
|-|-|
| Learn modern Pepper development | Follow the complete guide at [MyPepperApplication](https://github.com/unitedroboticsgroup-france/MyPepperApplication) - a comprehensive 2025 tutorial for Pepper development |
|-|-|
| Try Python programming online | Use [pepper.robothearts.dev](https://pepper.robothearts.dev) - an online Jupyter-based Python environment specifically for Pepper |
|-|-|
| Android app development | Build native Android applications using the Pepper SDK for Android |
|-|-|
| Add AI conversations | Integrate [robohearts.ai](https://robohearts.ai) - an LLM-based conversation solution that works seamlessly with Pepper 2.9 |
|-|-|
| Explore libraries and examples | Check out [SoftBank Robotics Labs](https://github.com/softbankrobotics-labs/) for useful libraries and code examples |

## Pepper 2.5 (Python-based) - Legacy Systems

Many Pepper robots still run NAOqi 2.5. For these systems:

| What do you want to do?    | How can you do that? |
|-|-|
| Visual programming; prototypes; animations | Use **Choregraphe**, downloadable [here](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/support/pepper/downloads-softwares) with [NAOqi 2.5 documentation](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/index.html) |
|-|-|
| Python development | Most [NAO Python examples]({{ site.baseurl }}/guide-to-nao/) work on Pepper 2.5 since they share the same NAOqi foundation |
|-|-|
| Add AI conversations | Use [robohearts.ai](https://robohearts.ai) which supports both NAO and Pepper 2.5 systems |
