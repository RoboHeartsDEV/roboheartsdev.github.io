Welcome to the NAO Programming Guide!

So, you want to program your NAO robot? There are many ways to do that!

| What do you want to do?    | How can you do that? |
|-|-|
| Simple visual programming; prototypes; animations    | Use **Choregraphe**, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/support/nao-6/downloads-softwares) and is well-covered by [the NAOqi 2.8 reference documentation](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-8/index.html) |
|-|-|
| Build applications in pure Python    | You can do that either [in Python 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/nao/2023-11-09-nao-python) (works out of the box), or [in Python 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/nao/2023-11-10-nao-python3) (requires installing an extra package)|
|-|-|
| Use ROS | See  [ROS for NAO]({{ site.baseurl }}/nao/2023-11-20-nao-ros)|
