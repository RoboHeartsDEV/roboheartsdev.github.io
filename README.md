Welcome to RoboHearts DEV!

Here we collect various ressources for programming NAO and Pepper, as a completent / alternative starting point to [the official documentation](http://doc.aldebaran.com/) (that is, on our opinion, often incomplete and out-of-date).

<div class="robot-guides">
  <div class="guide-card">
    <h2><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/guide-to-nao/">Guide to NAO</a></h2>
    <p>Use Python, Choregraphe, ROS, etc.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="guide-card">
    <h2><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/guide-to-pepper/">Guide to Pepper</a></h2>
    <p>For Pepper 2.9 (Android) or Pepper 2.5 (Python/Choregraphe)</p>
  </div>
