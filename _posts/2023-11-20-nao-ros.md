NAO is compatible with both ROS 1 and ROS 2. The core projects can be found under the [ros-naoqi organization on GitHub](https://github.com/ros-naoqi).

For a general introduction to ROS, see [ROS.org](https://www.ros.org/)

There is also a low-volume [ros-sig-aldebaran](https://groups.google.com/g/ros-sig-aldebaran) mailing list.

# ROS 2 (new)

Running a ROS 2 node from a computer that connects to NAO can be done with [naoqi_driver2](https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_driver2). This driver enables bridging between ROS 2 and NAOqi OS. For installation and usage instructions, refer to the repository's README.

# ROS 1

A general, introduction to NAO for ROS 1 is available on [RosWiki::NAO](https://wiki.ros.org/nao). This page covers the ROS driver for NAO, tutorials, basic configuration, hardware drivers, and high-level capabilities.

Key GitHub organizations for ROS 1 resources:
- [ros-naoqi](https://github.com/ros-naoqi): Hosts ROS stacks for Aldebaran's robots, including nao_robot, naoqi_driver, and nao_virtual packages.
- [SoftBank Robotics Research](https://github.com/softbankrobotics-research): Contains various projects, such as qibullet for simulation and naoqi_driver as a C++ bridge.
